# Database description
The idea is to make a portal/website which can you be used to hire employees/workers for the all the daily household/industrial needs. Daily needs include working at you home like gardening, plumbing, small-scale electricity works/repairs, wood work, et al. Industrial needs would include works at industrial scale or factory needs like ;arge scale ectricity works, IT-support team, workers capable of working with different sorts of machines, etc.

The point of the portal/website is to provide daily needs only for a small period of time (for eg. a few days or maybe a few weeks) and NOT FOREVER. All the workers/employees are owned by the portal/website and are not freelancers. After completing their job for which they are hired for, the workers/employees return back, ready to work for a new job.

COVID-19 got really hard for all of us, but most importantly, the ones who suffered the most were the daily workers. So, getting hiring someone online is easier for clients and getting  a job online is easier for the workers. Also, from the point of view of a client, it is always a cumbersome task to find someone for a daily need. So, this is where the portal comes and the saves the day.
